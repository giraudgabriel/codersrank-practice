              <p>
                Your next day will be better than today, but you will have
                to do your best to make it so. You will be doing something 
                worthwile, so get ready!
              </p>
              <h3>General recommendations:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't forget that you deserve caring about
                          yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>You are not starting/completing anything,
                          so don't think "I can't do this right now",
                          think "I'll rest / do something else for now" -
                          that's a more positive, outward mindset.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make the process as enjoyable as possible,
                          ask yourself instead of forcing; you both are 
                          arguing for the same case, so search for a 
                          compromise.
                        </li>

                <h2>Be honest with yourself</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Calm down, don't get emotions and assumptions get in the
                  way of judging yourself. Don't think about others, don't
                  think about what you want to become. Be objective and 
                  compare yourself to yesterday's self.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you did great one day, doesn't mean that you can or
                  should do that every day. You deserve rest too. don't 
                  push yourself too hard, and when you do, don't take it as
                  a baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Be grateful to others. It's your job to appreciate them,
                  and you should count on them when you need them. Be careful,
                  but being alone and only counting on yourself is not an 
                  option.
